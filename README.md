# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on a user's favorite movie. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and director, and employs cosine similarity to find the most similar movies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- **index**: A unique identifier for each movie.
- **budget**: The budget of the movie.
- **genres**: Movie genres.
- **homepage**: The official homepage of the movie.
- **id**: The movie's ID.
- **keywords**: Keywords associated with the movie.
- **original_language**: The original language of the movie.
- **original_title**: The original title of the movie.
- **overview**: A brief summary of the movie's plot.
- **popularity**: Popularity score of the movie.
- **production_companies**: Companies involved in the production.
- **production_countries**: Countries where the movie was produced.
- **release_date**: The release date of the movie.
- **revenue**: The revenue generated by the movie.
- **runtime**: Duration of the movie in minutes.
- **spoken_languages**: Languages spoken in the movie.
- **status**: Current status (Released, Upcoming, etc.).
- **tagline**: Tagline of the movie.
- **title**: Movie title.
- **vote_average**: Average rating of the movie.
- **vote_count**: Number of votes the movie received.
- **cast**: Main cast members of the movie.
- **crew**: Crew members involved in the production.
- **director**: The director of the movie.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
## Dataset

3. **Download the dataset**: Make sure to have the dataset (`movies.csv`) in the same directory as the code. The dataset should contain the columns mentioned above.

## How It Works

The system uses the following process to recommend movies:

1. **Preprocessing**:
    - The columns `genres`, `keywords`, `tagline`, `cast`, and `director` are combined to form a single feature vector for each movie. Missing values in these columns are filled with an empty string.
    
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
    - The text data is transformed into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorization. This helps in quantifying the significance of the words in the movie metadata.
    
3. **Cosine Similarity**:
    - Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between the user's favorite movie and the other movies in the dataset.
    
4. **Movie Name Matching with `difflib`**:
    - To ensure the input movie name matches closely with the actual titles in the dataset, the `difflib` library is used to find the closest matches. This handles cases where the user may slightly misspell the movie title.
    
5. **Recommendation**:
    - After finding the correct movie name using `difflib`, the system recommends up to 30 movies that are most similar to the input movie.

## Usage

1. Run the code:

   ```bash
   python movie_recommendation.py
2. Input your favorite movie name when prompted. The `difflib` library will find the closest match to the input if there's a slight misspelling or variation.

The system will output the top 30 recommended movies based on the similarity score.

## Example
If you input the movie name "Incepton" (misspelled), the difflib library will match it to "Inception" and then recommend movies based on that: 
  
1. ```bash
   Recommended movies based on Inception:
   1. Interstellar
   2. The Dark Knight
   3. The Prestige
   ...

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- Numpy: For numerical computations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: For vectorizing text data and computing cosine similarity.
- difflib: For matching the input movie name with the closest available title.
